# Sorting-Hat
I've been a great Harrypotter fan since my childhood. This is a fun Sorting Hat project that assigns users to Hogwarts houses based on input. Using decision algorithms, it simulates the Sorting Hat experience from Harry Potter, combining randomness and personalization for an interactive and engaging sorting process.
